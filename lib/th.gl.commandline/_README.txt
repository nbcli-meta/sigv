INSTALL

1. Place the entire folder "th.gl.commandline" in your Max searchpath. Suggested locations are under ~/Documents/Max (7/8)/Packages or ~/Documents/Max (7/8)/Library.

2. Restart Max to make sure the folder is loaded by the File Browser.

3. Create a new patcher with CMD + N.

4. Create a new object with "n" and type th.gl.commandline. The object will initialize. You can now right-click the object to open the helpfile.

5. Read the helpfile carefully, then open the Big Example to play with some of the jit.gl objects, or of course build your own things with the editor as user interface to control parameters!
