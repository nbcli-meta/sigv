| ∆ | SERIAL | Notation |
| --- | --- | --- |
| v | crow volts | ∆ c r |
| i | crow input | ∆ l m 1 1 |
| p | gpio pulse | ∆ p d 7 |
| a | gpio analog | ∆ a 4 s |
| m | mcu message | ∆ m 1 |
| o | crow open | ∆ o |

The ∆ gpio serial commands are meant to be used primarily via a securely connected (SSH) RaspberryPi, and thus controlling its GPIO pins with the Python library gpiozero. (Blueberry Framework)
